# Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree

## Overview

This repository contains materials, projects, and exercises completed as part of the **Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree** program. This Nanodegree program is designed to help learners develop foundational skills in programming, data analysis, and working with Python, SQL, and Git.

## Objectives

By completing this program, learners gain practical experience in:
- Writing efficient Python code for data manipulation and analysis.
- Querying and managing databases using SQL.
- Leveraging Git for version control and collaboration.
- Applying data science workflows to real-world problems.

## Program Structure

The program is divided into three major modules:

### 1. **Introduction to Python**
   - Learn the basics of Python programming, including:
     - Variables, data types, and operators.
     - Loops and conditional statements.
     - Functions, modules, and error handling.
   - Work with Python libraries such as `NumPy` and `pandas` for data manipulation.

### 2. **Introduction to SQL**
   - Understand the fundamentals of databases and SQL.
   - Perform queries, aggregations, and joins to extract and analyze data.
   - Learn how to create, update, and manage databases.

### 3. **Version Control with Git**
   - Master the basics of Git for version control.
   - Create and manage repositories on GitHub.
   - Collaborate on projects using branches, commits, pull requests, and merges.

## Projects

The Nanodegree program includes several hands-on projects to apply the skills learned:

1. **Explore US Bikeshare Data**  
   Analyze data from a bike-sharing system in major US cities to uncover usage patterns and trends.

2. **PostgreSQL Database Analysis**  
   Write SQL queries to extract insights from a relational database.

3. **Git Commands Documentation**  
   Create a comprehensive guide documenting Git commands and workflows.

## Tools and Technologies

Throughout the program, the following tools and technologies are used:
- **Python**: For scripting and data analysis.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing databases.
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive Python coding and visualization.
